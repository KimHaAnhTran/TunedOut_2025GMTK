# About Game
Jeanie is caught in a loop, stuck in the same old routine day-in and -out. Help her break out of the daily grind in this narrative-based, sidewalk-shredding, music-pumping, momentum-based platformer. <br>
By switching between her two cassette tapes, Jeanie activates a single-use ability, indicated by an icon in the upper corner. These two powers are a speed boost (great for getting up ramps and clearing large gaps) and an extra jump (great for clearing those pesky obstacles).  <br>
Each cassette also determines which rails Jeanie can ride, but she can only ride the rail corresponding to the color of her current tape.  <br>
Quick reflexes are key: swap cassettes at the right moment to navigate each level, beat the clock, and finally escape the endless cycle of her daily grind.
 ## Controls
- [A] and [D] to move. [Spacebar] to jump. 
- [Left shift] or [Z] to change the music.
- Changing the music activates an ability that's either a speed boost or bonus jump.
- Rails can only be rode when you're listening to the correct color cassette.
- Make it to the finish line before the time runs out.
# Background
This is my our team's submission to the 2025 GMTK game jam with the theme of loop. The game is made with Godot in 3 days. This is also my first Github collaboration.
